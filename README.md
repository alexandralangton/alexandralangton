### Hi there! I'm Alexandra, a software engineer and project manager.

Welcome to my GitHub! Thanks for stopping by&mdash;feel free to have a browse through my projects.

I've pinned some of my most recent projects below. I'm currently working on my [Google Chrome Extension](https://github.com/alexandralangton/UKEN-Chrome-Extension), which translates websites from :us: into :uk: English.

You can get an extended overview of my projects and tech stack on my portfolio website, which is [deployed here](https://alexandralangton.com/).

Feel free to reach out via my portfolio site with any queries or comments! I'm more than happy to talk tech any time. :relaxed:
